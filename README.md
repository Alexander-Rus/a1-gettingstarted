## Technical Achievements
- **Completed Assignemnt Goals**: I successfully edited the index.html code to describe my name, 
class, major, minor, previous computer science classes, and my proficiency with the desired languages. The pull request is added to github as well.
- **I added a CSS Style Sheet**: I added my own Css style sheet that I created to give my page more a  pleasing astetic. I tweaked the
server.js file to make sure this sheet would load properly. 
- **I added multiple clickable links**: For many of the images I made them clickable so that you can get more information should you want to.
- **I added a Hobbie Section**: I added an additional hobbie section so that you can learn a little bit more about me.


### Design Achievements
- **I added multiple Images, Some with Animation**: I added multiple different images, some of them have slight animations that key
the user to click on them.
- **I created a Header**: To give the page more of a portfolio feel, I added a header with a banner image of boston, which is then followed by supplimental information
- **I added specific sections**: The original index.html did not clearly distinguish between the sections, so I added some card like divisions to help seperate the sections of information.
