        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
       I am a senior here at WPI. I have always enjoyed working with computers and finding creative and intuitive solutions
        to problems. This past summer I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at a start-up company called GreenChoice PBC.
        The company manages a mobile app that helps people buy healthy and sustainable groceries when they go grocery shopping.
        While there I worked on the back-end systems that calculate the level of processing for different food products as well 
        as assist the mobile app development team. It was a really great experience and I am glad I had the opportunity to learn 
        so much in an area I have always been interested in.

        Hobbies
      </h2>  
      <p>
        During my time at WPI I have taken a number of computer science courses, but I have also taken a few art classes.
        What I have come to appreciate over time is the really fascinating connection between art and STEM. I am 
        especially intereseted in this class because I want to understand how artistic interpretation can interwork with Computer Science.
        These are some images of a Santa Clause Sculpture I made:

      <p>
        I enjoy programming and problem solving. I really like exercising and eating healthy.
        I am a member of the Varsity Track and Field Team at WPI. In my free time I like to watch movies, go to museums, eat at fancy restaurants, and learn new programming skills.
